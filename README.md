##### Industry/Sector of your Idea:

 Fintech/Stock Market
 Technology in use: flask framework, API, Machine Learning, Artificial Inteligence and BlockChain

##### How did the idea originate?
Profit making is objective of all investors. But I have observed they face information delay or they are uninformed many times before investment. Another observation I did not miss and studied journals to annex here that only micro and macro numbers are not enough features to predict. 
I tried to solve the problem in my work related to automatic trading and equity research. I felt the same problem is persisting among all retail investors since 1995 in Indian stock market. But misvaluation is more common to them because of advancement of prediction system. 

##### What problem(s) are you trying to address?
Decentralization/crowd sourcing of stock related published and unpublished information/opinion. Real time/unsupervised structured tagging of investors comment/opinion and information. Application of this to reduce risk of investment and in building investment strategies.    

##### Who are your primary customers?
All analysts, retail investors,traders and fund houses in equity segment are customers. 


##### Describe your market opportunity
Alpha generation using micro and macro numbers with qualitative data are common. Use of wisdom of crowd is less in use here but few start ups in USA are doing well and beating wall street for last couple of years.  
Market is huge but segmented and scattered. Informed Investors or thriving for informed decision making before investment from metro, urban, semi-urban will slowly increase by gradual inclusion due to increased alpha, better accuracy and minimized risk.

##### What is your proposed solution?
Machine learning models using micro/macro/published/unpublished data from crowed, large pool of active investors will increase predictability,accuracy, alpha and will minimized risk indirectly. So decentralization of information/crowd sourcing of stock related wisdom, published and unpublished information/opinion. Real time/unsupervised structured tagging of investors comment/opinion and information are key to solve this problem.

##### What is the innovation in your proposed solution?
Equity research, valuation, rating and news are easily available along with micro/macro data to any system. These inputs along with opinion/tagged data from crowd will be added to multi layered black box to get output. This output will be input to participants/users for decision making. So this propagation will be back and forth to users by application of  technologies related web, iOS and android application, API, and BlockChain.
