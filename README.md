##### Industry/Sector of your Idea:

 Fintech/Stock Market
 Technology in use: flask framework, API, Machine Learning, Artificial Inteligence and BlockChain

##### How did the idea originate?
Profit making is objective of all investors. But I have observed they face information delay or they are uninformed many times before investment. Another observation I did not miss and studied journals to annex here that only micro and macro numbers are not enough features to predict. 
I tried to solve the problem in my work related to automatic trading and equity research. I felt the same problem is persisting among all retail investors since 1995 in Indian stock market. But misvaluation is more common to them because of advancement of prediction system. 

##### What problem(s) are you trying to address?
Decentralization/crowd sourcing of stock related published and unpublished information/opinion. Real time/unsupervised structured tagging of investors comment/opinion and information. Application of this to reduce risk of investment and in building investment strategies.    

##### Who are your primary customers?
All analysts, retail investors and fund houses are customers.
