##### Industry/Sector of your Idea:

 Fintech/Stock Market
 
 Technology in use: flask framework, API, Machine Learning, Artificial Inteligence and BlockChain

##### How did the idea originate?
Profit making is objective of all investors. But I have observed they face information delay or they are uninformed many times before investment. Another observation I did not miss and studied journals to annex here that only micro and macro numbers are not enough features to predict. 
I tried to solve the problem in my work related to automatic trading and equity research. I felt the same problem is persisting among all retail investors since 1995 in Indian stock market. But misvaluation is more common to them because of advancement of prediction system. 

##### What problem(s) are you trying to address?
Decentralization/crowd sourcing of stock related published and unpublished information/opinion. Real time/unsupervised structured tagging of investors comment/opinion and information. Application of this to reduce risk of investment and in building investment strategies.    

##### Who are your primary customers?
All analysts, retail investors,traders and fund houses in equity segment are customers. 


##### Describe your market opportunity
Alpha generation using micro and macro numbers with qualitative data are common. Use of wisdom of crowd is less in use here but few start ups in USA are doing well and beating wall street for last couple of years.  
Market is huge but segmented and scattered. Informed Investors or thriving for informed decision making before investment from metro, urban, semi-urban will slowly increase by gradual inclusion due to increased alpha, better accuracy and minimized risk.

##### What is your proposed solution?
Machine learning models using micro/macro/published/unpublished data from crowed, large pool of active investors will increase predictability,accuracy, alpha and will minimized risk indirectly. So decentralization of information/crowd sourcing of stock related wisdom, published and unpublished information/opinion. Real time/unsupervised structured tagging of investors comment/opinion and information are key to solve this problem.

##### What is the innovation in your proposed solution?
Equity research, valuation, rating and news are easily available along with micro/macro data to any system. These inputs along with opinion/tagged data from crowd will be added to multi layered black box to get output. This output will be input to participants/users for decision making. So this propagation will be back and forth to users by application of  technologies related web, iOS and android application, API, and BlockChain. 

##### What is the expected impact of your proposed solution?
1. This can beat the existing estimation of centralized sources like Broker/ Fund houses.
2. Retails investors will be more informed and timely. Indirectly good enough to reduce the holding risk.
3. Easier to make investment decision.
4. Cost and time of information acquisition will be reduced significantly. 
5. More investors will be included in the market. 

##### In your opinion, is this the best time to solve the problem? why?
Yes this is the best time because the cost of acquisition of technology is lesser and human resources in this field are less but available in India. Presence of BaaS, Cloud, GPUs are now available to develop this Idea. 
Importantly this is right time because people are well aware of digital money and BlockChain/Etherium/BitCoin.

##### What is the biggest challenge that you foresee in implementing your solution?
1. We have a team but do not have experience of application of BlockChain.
2. Security and Software Safety factor
3. Testing time may be high in India.
4. Legal issues related to stocks, payment, blockchain, trading

##### What are the currently available alternatives to your proposed solution?
Few Broker houses are using these concepts like twitter based sentiment analysis, web scrapping based sentiment analysis, deep learning based prediction models etc. and few other alternatives are available. A close alternative http://www.heckyl.com/ is already in market. These below sites are operative, weakly or highly related to capital market in US market. Few websites are already in USA market.

##### How is your solution different from these alternatives?(Describe your value proposition.)

Few websites are already in USA market. But These services are not available in India. My solution is new or may be few start ups are working on this but not known to me is not competition, as existence of few services are helpful for awareness and helpful for easier inclusion of investors. The machine learning model and application in this idea will always be different from one another and this will be benefit to users. Attractiveness and easier application will be key and different from future entrants. Being early mover we have more mined data for competitiveness. 

##### What other industries/market segments can your proposed solution/technology/innovation be applied to?
Application of sentiment analysis is not limited to stock market but models etc. are not similar for application to other sectors/industries/assets/markets. In future, expansion to other Asian markets and Industries like Capital Goods, Automobile can be explored. 
##### What is your growth strategy for the next 2 years?
1. The client base of Broker houses is huge, so use of our application is beneficial to both ends. Brokers will get data of specific group under them. 
2. Daily rewards, ranking and competition to attract users for direct selling. 

##### Describe your traction till date.(Number of paying users/customers, weekly active users on the website,number of institutional partners/suppliers/distributors etc.)
This is still in development phase and expected to complete a portion by January 2018. 
##### In your opinion, why are you and your team best suited to solve the problem?
1. 2 members are handling technicals like front and back-end. They have programming and coding experience of more than 5 years. 
2. 1 Co- founder has sales and administration experience 
3. 1 team members has experience of service,sales. He Has more than 2 years of experience. 
4. Another Co-founder is able to handle ML,data analysis and stock market related work with more than 6 years of experience. 

Combination and diversion of the team is able to solve the problem. Another expert is needed to handle block-chain related issues. 
##### What is your revenue model?
1.  Sharing prediction signal to Broker/Financial Institutions/Fund Houses/Advisors
2. Share of commission with  different brokers via broker API. 
3. Fixed earning from investors as subscription or profit sharing above water mark.
4. Providing cleaned, processed stock market data directly from NSE to users 
5. Earning from advisory and advisory portfolio management.
