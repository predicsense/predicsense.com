I can perceive risk, can take risk and challenge. I have patience and I love to learn new.  I always try to teach young and searching better scope.  More comfortable to numbers than complex text.

I have exposure to both investment banking ( Hedge Fund, HSBC) and entrepreneurship space. I know the problems in these space. I'll try to understand more and learn to solve those people's problem by bridging gap and connecting sources and users.  I'll be happy to choose the right persons for the fund or by creating awareness to them. My programming skill, exposure to finance and entrepreneurship  will be in action from this duty will be another point of satisfaction.  

Any startup working on social inclusion and economic value is my interest. Especially I like those are  working deep in closing gap  with big or disrupting nature, not copied from western model but mostly based on Indian scenario.  Many startups are in that category,but those are in the sectors which I understand I admire them. 

Finance and transportation ( including automobiles) are two sectors excite me most but few others like education sector, software sector to mention here. In these sectors application related to 
1. Financial Market
2. Blockchain for financial transactions
3. Self Driving car/ transportation
4. And any unique  ( those I admire most) AI and ML application. 
Those  excite me very much because I have understanding of advancement of few technologies and I read ( also write) stories from these sectors about the gaps and scopes. 

I have started operation of my own start up Algoix Technologies LLP ( Bangalore) from Jan 2018. I have limited involvement of AI, ML application development here, that I wish to do in weekends. I hope this will not create any conflict of interest but I like to discuss if needed.
