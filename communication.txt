Making templates for website PREDICSENSE using HTML/CSS/JS. The look of the website will be very simple and easy to understand with a black gradient background (ending with faded black).

Ok let me tell you ,, we want somebody to build the templates using HTML, I will provide you the sketches and the add ons to be added. this whole website will be of around 6 pages. A flask app is in developing process and we need to connect the same flask app with this website but you do not have to take care of the same. You should build the templates in such a manner that we will be able to connect the app later on. we just need you to handle the front. Back end is handled by our experts
