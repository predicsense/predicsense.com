The need for the program.

Unwrapping numbers and sentiment for accuracy will help users to know the sentiment and their deviation from average.
Once the numbers and sentiments are divided then it becomes much easier for the users to make a decision.
Number creates the clarity by mapping the nearness to intrinsic price of the asset where as unknowing sentiments originates
biasness and error into buy and selling points. They together creates confusion and obscurity for the users and we separate 
numbers and sentiments.

Alpha generation.



How our service gets client.

There was an incident which we would like to share. One of our colleague was interested in trade. He started trading with a huge book of knowledge regarding trading. But every day was not the same for him. He was not that tech. We as a friend used to sit together in the evening and share our daily activities and relax. One day, very recently he said that he is missing what he thinks. Yes! It is confusing and we asked the same what? What does it mean. He said he is able to predict that one particular share will go up today but he was not able to make out the same when he was deciding. He asked for a solution from us. Luckily our discussion for that day was about doing business and the analytic one of our friend who was right there came up with the idea of assistance. Again we went blank and asked for clarification. He immediately recognised that the problem was confusion which is for the numbers and sentiments. Both are acting together in that person when he is trading and stopping him from getting him the winning vibe that he had predicted. If we can divide these two then the problem will be solved. That guy was very much excited and asked how soon can it be applied. He the analytic started his invention and after many sleepless days and nights he came up with a robot which is able to divide the sentiments and numbers and trading on behalf. We used the same technology and that person was overwhelmed as he got to know that his predictions were right  but to a little extent, this technology is predicting which he had never thought of or never ever knew. From that day we all decided that everybody on the earth should have this winning vibe, then everybody will be happy and tension free. This technology will actually save time. So here we are with the same technology for you ‘PREDICSENSE’.
