Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a "hold" rating to a "buy" rating. They now have a $32.00 price target on the stock. 13.0% upside from the previous close of $28.31. According to Zacks, "Deutsche Bank reported a twofold rise in net income for second-quarter 2015, reflecting higher revenues and lower provision for credit losses. However, continued rise in non-interest expenses due to litigation provisions remained the undermining factor. Amid the worldwide economic volatility and the continuing Eurozone crisis, the company is focused on building its capital level. Strategy 2020 efforts are encouraging and we expect the initiative to help improve operating efficiency. Nevertheless, given the stressed operating environment and ongoing litigation issues, we do not expect any significant improvement in earnings in the near term."
