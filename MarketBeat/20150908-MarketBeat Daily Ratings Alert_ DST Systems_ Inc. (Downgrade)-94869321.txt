DST Systems, Inc. (NYSE:DST) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a "hold" rating to a "sell" rating. Previous closing price of $102.65. According to Zacks, "DST Systems reported mixed second-quarter 2015 results, wherein the bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line beat the same by a narrow margin. Also, the quarter’s revenues increased on a year-over-year basis. Fewer client additions, unfavorable market conditions and lower-than-expected revenues from its operating segments adversely impacted the results. Furthermore, decreasing organic revenue growth, tough competition from IBM and Fiserv, and a high debt burden remain concerns. Nonetheless, we believe that steady contributions from the acquisitions will support revenue growth in long-run. Moreover, DST Systems’ business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services should attract customers."
