Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a "sell" rating to a "hold" rating. Previous closing price of $108.52. According to Zacks, "Ameriprise’s second-quarter 2015 operating earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Growth in revenues was partly offset by higher expenses and unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. We believe that the company’s discipline in financial planning as well as strengths in product development and advice helps it meet dynamic market needs, thereby accelerating the growth pace. Also, the company’s steady capital deployment activities continue to depict strong balance sheet position. However, weak cost control and persistent outflows in the Asset Management segment are expected to keep the financials under strain in the near term."
