Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a "hold" rating to a "buy" rating. They now have a $193.00 price target on the stock. 12.1% upside from the previous close of $172.13. According to Zacks, "Advance Auto Parts reported a rise in adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Moreover, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues also went up year over year, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The year-over-year improvement in sales was driven by benefits from the addition of new stores over the last 12 months and an increase in comparable store sales. Advance Auto Parts will gain from its focus on store expansion. However, rising new vehicle sales and price competition are headwinds. Meanwhile, benefits from acquisitions and the increasing average age of vehicles will further boost the results of the company."
