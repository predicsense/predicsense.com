Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE:AMG) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a "hold" rating to a "sell" rating. Previous closing price of $173.25. According to Zacks, "Affiliated Managers’ second-quarter 2015 economic net income (ENI) outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the back of consistent growth in revenues. However, elevated operating expenses remained a headwind during the quarter. We believe the company’s successful partnerships and global distribution capability along with diverse product mix will pave the way for future growth. Also, the company’s restructuring initiatives undertaken to strengthen retail market operations is bound to work in its favour. Though the company continues to invest in new affiliates, we remain apprehensive regarding the impact of weak cost control, elevated debt levels and higher intangibles on its near-term profitability."
