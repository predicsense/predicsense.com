HD Supply Holdings Inc (NYSE:HDS) had its "outperform" rating reaffirmed by analysts at William Blair. Previous closing price of $32.17. The analysts wrote, "Expecting In-Line Quarter and Guidance for Double-Digit EBITDA Growth In-line quarter should be enough to keep stock moving higher. We expect another in- line quarter as end-market fundamentals remain positive. We continue to favor U.S. residential and nonresidential construction names over industrial exposed companies and would use the recent stock weakness to add to positions. On a mid-July conference call, management said second-quarter (May-July) results were on track to hit the midpoint of guidance (sales up 5%-8%; EBITDA up 9%-15%). We are modeling 6% sales growth, with EBITDA up 12%, to $251 million. Consensus EBITDA at $257 million looks comfortable as we see upside to our gross margin estimate of 32.7%. In recent quarters, EBITDA has outgrown sales by more than 2 times, and we believe leverage will be equally strong in the second quarter. In our view, accelerating growth in waterworks following a wet spring and improved outgrowth in facilities maintenance and waterworks after a slightly softer first-quarter result will be important. We would like to see organic growth trending in the 6%-7% range in July and August now that weather effects are behind us. Third-quarter consensus EBITDA growth of 16% likely frames high end of guidance. We expect third-quarter consensus sales growth of 7% and EBITDA at $267 million (up 16%) to frame the high end of guidance. With the sales comparison becoming more difficult, we expect the high end of sales growth guidance to be 7%- 8%. We agree EBITDA growth can continue at about 2.0 times sales growth, leaving 16% growth at the top of the likely range. At the bottom of the range, sales should be up 5%, with EBITDA up 8%.”"
